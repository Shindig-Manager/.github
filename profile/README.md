# Shindig Manager
Shindig Manager will be a suite of products for event managers and speakers.  Emphasizing on community technology events such as [Code PaLOUsa](https://www.codepalousa.com), the event management products will provide tools for the overall management of the event along with speaker, sponsor, and attendee management.  For speakers, there will be the Speaking Engagement Manager which will allow speakers to manage their abstracts and track where those get submitted.  There will also be provisions for showing profile and speaking information on a speaker's website.

While providing essential services for speakers and events, Shindig Manager will also be used by Chad Green as part of technology and practice demonstrations within event presentations on on [TaleLearnCode](https://twitch.tv/TaleLearnCode).
